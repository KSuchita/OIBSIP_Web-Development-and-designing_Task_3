🌡️ Just wrapped up a Temperature Converter Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🎉
This interactive project lets users input temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or even Kelvin, then instantly converts and displays the result with the correct unit. From input validation to dynamic UI updates, this was a great exercise in user-focused functionality and clean interface design.
🔧 Key features:
Number validation for smooth user experience
Radio buttons for selecting input units
"Convert" trigger with instant output
Bonus: support for Kelvin conversions for those science-savvy moments!
